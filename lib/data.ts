An appointment scheduler and calendar were created, leading to a 1.5 times boost in the sales teamâ€™s productivity. To enhance user experience and efficiency, a robust API for appointments was engineered, reducing front-end loading time by 30%. The integration of the National ID Aadhar API and OTP Service for agreement signing resulted in a remarkable 60% acceleration in client onboarding. Further streamlining was achieved through the implementation of end-to-end automation from Payment (Paytm Payment Service) to Invoice creation (JsDom). This initiative cut down processing time from 24-48 hours and reached a containment level of 92%.`,
